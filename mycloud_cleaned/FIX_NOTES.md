Fix notes for mycloud project
-----------------------------
Changes made by assistant:
1. Updated dependency "react-scripts" -> "5.0.1" in package.json.
2. Removed node_modules directory to force a clean npm install (run `npm install`).
3. Removed src/main.jsx to avoid duplicate entry points (src/index.js is the CRA entry).

Suggested next steps (run locally):
- Run `npm install` (or `yarn`) to reinstall dependencies.
- Run `npm start` to start the dev server.
- If CSS still doesn't load:
  * Ensure there are no console errors in browser devtools.
  * Check public/index.html has <div id="root"></div> (it does).
  * If using Tailwind, ensure PostCSS/Tailwind config present and build step configured.

If you want, I can also convert this project to Vite or Next.js for a modern setupâ€”tell me and I'll scaffold changes.
